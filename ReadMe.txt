In this project I was able to somewhat implement the scrabble game using html,
css, javascript, and jQuery. Throught this project I learned how to use
javascript by using the containers and functions to do small tasks such as keep
track of the score, generate the tiles and many more. JQuery helped me learn how
to use these function so that they can be displayed on the window and allow me
to perform interesting features such as being able to drag and drop the tiles.
This was a fun project however I did not put nearly as much effort due to Finals.
Especially since one of my finals was on the same day HW5 was due. I apologize
for the incomplete work! Thanks for your time.
